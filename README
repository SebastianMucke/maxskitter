## Configuration
### Skitter options

You can configure skitter options in 3 places (its up to you which one you use, but remember, that Page config will overwrite SiteConfig & staticConfig and SiteConfig will overwrite staticConfig).

**StaticConfig example (placed in mysite/_config.php):**

```php
MaxSkitterDefaults::set_staticConfig(array(
    "animation" => "'cube'",
    "easing_default" => "'easeOutBack'",
    "animateNumberActive" => "{backgroundColor:'#004581', color:'#fff'}",
    "navigation" => "false",
    "label" => "false"
));
```

**SiteConfig:**

Find Skitter tab in your SiteConfig section. Place exactly same values as on skitter homepage: http://www.thiagosf.net/projects/jquery/skitter/.
So if you want cube animation, place in the field: 'cube', if you dont need navigation place in the field: false...

**Page config:**

Exactly same as SiteConfig, config tab places in Root.ContentSkitterConfig tab of your Page.

### Configuration of Skitter box size and Skitter images size:

If you are fine with cropped resizing of your images, you can configure dimension in you mysite/_config.php. Example:

```php
MaxSkitterImageDecorator::$SkitterSlideWidth = 850;
MaxSkitterImageDecorator::$SkitterSlideHeight = 250;
```

Default box size is 800x300px which will not suit your needs in many case. This size is defined in maxskitter/css/skitter.styles.css. You can copy this file to your theme and edit as you need, or you can just create css called skitter.custom.css in your theme and edit only what you need, example:

```css
.box_skitter {position:relative;width:850px;height:250px;background:#fff;}
.box_skitter .info_slide {right:15px; left: auto}
```

if you dont like used cropped resize, use your own copy of file maxskitter/code/MaxSkitterImageDecorator.php (with custom name of class and methods), enable it in your mysite/_config.php and copy  maxskitter/templates/Includes/SkitterImage.ss in your theme and change called image resizing method name.

## Adding slides

Each page has tab with Slides manager (Root.Content.SkitterSlides), which enables uploading and managing Skitter Slides. If you need reorder slides, make sure you saved current selection. Only checked (enabled) Slides are shown on the Page (because same Slides can be used on multiple Pages, you must have an option to enable/disable Slides on any Page. By default (after uploading) are Slides disabled - not checked).

## Showing slides in Template

Place in your desired template file (this will generate Skitter HTML if slides available and nothing if no slides defined):

```html
$SkitterSlidesRecursive
```

or (this will show your no-slide image if no slides available)

```html
<% if SkitterSlidesRecursive %>
	$SkitterSlidesRecursive
<% else %>
	<img src="$themedir/images/no-slide.jpg" alt="" />
<% end_if %>
```
